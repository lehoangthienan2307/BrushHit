# Brush Hit
A 3D game consists of multiple levels, each with 3-4 rounds. The player controls a 
device with two parts: an anchor hub and a rotating hub that can rotate 360 
degrees. When the player clicks or taps, the rotating hub stops, and it's the anchor
hub's turn to rotate. The player's task is to color all rubbers within the round and 
can only move on the positions of these objects. If the player moves off the 
platforms, they lose. The platforms can move, and there are enemy AI that attempt 
to revert the colored objects back to their original state. The score is determined by 
the number of rubbers the player successfully colors, with additional score
awarded for creating combos through consecutive successful colorings. The player 
can retry a round at any time
# Progression Report
## Goals and Objectives
In approaching this Unity3D game test, my primary objective is to successfully 
fulfill all the specified test requirements while have both good UI and logic. Also, I 
want to add my ideas to upgrade the gameplay

## Progress Overview:
### Day 1:
Analyze the test guidelines and gameplay logic to gain a clear understanding 
of the project's requirements and functionalities.
Set up the foundational 3D project environment.
Implemented core gameplay components, including character, controls, and 
camera mechanics,..
### Day 2:
- Design UI
- Implement the game's level system, integrating features that allow for progression.
- Refined the core gameplay mechanics, including win and loss conditions
### Day 3:
- Implement AI enemy and dynamic platform movement.
- Adjust the physics of the Brush element for improved interaction and add particle effects 
- Integrated sound elements
### Day 4:
- Develope a score system with combo capabilities.
- Implement special skills for the player character.
- Designed additional gameplay levels.
- Refine and polish the UI elements.

# Final Outcome
The end product is a 3D game that covers most of the required features. While 
there wasn't enough time to incorporate new game ideas and there are a few minor 
bugs, the game still fulfills the essential aspects of being visually engaging, having 
sound elements, and providing an enjoyable gameplay experience. I plan to work 
on adding new features in the near future to enhance the game further

The player can use the button on the right to extend the coloring range, available 
once per round. Ideally, there should be a cooldown period and a duration for the 
effect, but I wasn't able to implement it in time. I'll add these features later.
